Let's walkthrough the script `cert_ecdsa_client.sh`, which is designed to
create an ECDSA client certificate. This script handles the generation of the
private key, creation of the Certificate Signing Request (CSR), issuance of the
certificate, creation of an extension file, bundling the certificate with an
intermediate CA chain, and verifying the certificate and its chain bundle. It
also converts the certificate into different formats suitable for various
applications.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

## Script Metadata

- **Filename**: `cert_ecdsa_client.sh`
- **Author**: GJS (homelab-alpha)
- **Date**: June 9, 2024
- **Version**: 1.0.1
- **Description**: This script automates the generation of an ECDSA client
  certificate, including key creation, CSR generation, certificate issuance, and
  verification.
- **RAW Script**: [cert_ecdsa_client.sh]

<br />

## Detailed Explanation

### Functions

1. **print_cyan**: This function prints text in cyan color for better
   readability in the terminal.

   ```bash
   print_cyan() {
     echo -e "\e[36m$1\e[0m" # \e[36m sets text color to cyan, \e[0m resets it
   }
   ```

    <br />

2. **generate_random_hex**: This function generates a random hexadecimal value,
   which is used for serial numbers and CRL numbers.

   ```bash
   generate_random_hex() {
     openssl rand -hex 16
   }
   ```

    <br />

3. **print_section_header**: This function prints section headers in cyan to
   clearly delineate different parts of the script.

   ```bash
   print_section_header() {
     echo ""
     echo ""
     echo -e "$(print_cyan "=== $1 === ")"
   }
   ```

<br />

## Main Script Execution

### Prompt for Certificate Information

The script prompts the user for the certificate name and FQDN.

```bash
read -r -p "$(print_cyan "Enter the name of the new certificate: ")" file_name
read -r -p "$(print_cyan "Enter the FQDN name of the new certificate: ")" fqdn
```

<br />

### Define Directory Paths

It defines the necessary directory paths for storing SSL files and certificates.

```bash
print_section_header "Define directory paths"
ssl_dir="$HOME/ssl"
certificates_dir="$ssl_dir/certificates"
intermediate_dir="$ssl_dir/intermediate"
```

<br />

### Renew Database Serial Numbers

The script renews database serial numbers by generating random hex values and
writing them to the respective serial files for the root, intermediate, and TSA
directories.

```bash
print_section_header "Renew db serial numbers"
for dir in "$ssl_dir/root/db" "$intermediate_dir/db" "$ssl_dir/tsa/db"; do
  generate_random_hex >"$dir/serial"
done
generate_random_hex >"$ssl_dir/root/db/crlnumber"
generate_random_hex >"$intermediate_dir/db/crlnumber"
```

<br />

### Generate ECDSA Key

It generates an ECDSA key using the secp384r1 curve and saves it to the private
directory for the client certificate.

```bash
print_section_header "Generate ECDSA key"
openssl ecparam -name secp384r1 -genkey -out "$certificates_dir/private/${file_name}.pem"
```

<br />

### Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

The script creates a CSR for the client certificate using the generated ECDSA
key and a configuration file.

```bash
print_section_header "Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR)"
openssl req -new -sha384 -config "$certificates_dir/cert.cnf" -key "$certificates_dir/private/${file_name}.pem" -out "$certificates_dir/csr/${file_name}.pem"
```

<br />

### Create an Extfile with All the Alternative Names

It creates an extfile with parameters for the client certificate, such as key
usage and extended key usage.

```bash
print_section_header "Create an extfile with all the alternative names"
{
  echo "basicConstraints = critical, CA:FALSE"
  echo "keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature"
  echo "extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth, emailProtection"
  echo "nsCertType = client, email"
  echo "nsComment = OpenSSL Generated Client Certificate"
} >>"$certificates_dir/extfile/${file_name}.cnf"
```

<br />

### Generate Certificate

The script issues the certificate based on the CSR and extfile, valid for a
specific period.

```bash
print_section_header "Generate Certificate"
openssl ca -config "$certificates_dir/cert.cnf" -notext -batch -in "$certificates_dir/csr/${file_name}.pem" -out "$certificates_dir/certs/${file_name}.pem" -extfile "$certificates_dir/extfile/${file_name}.cnf"
```

<br />

### Create Certificate Chain Bundle

It creates a certificate chain bundle by concatenating the client certificate
and the intermediate CA chain bundle.

```bash
print_section_header "Create Certificate Chain Bundle"
cat "$certificates_dir/certs/${file_name}.pem" "$intermediate_dir/certs/ca_chain_bundle.pem" >"$certificates_dir/certs/${file_name}_chain_bundle.pem"
```

<br />

### Verification Steps

The script performs several verification steps to ensure the integrity and
correctness of the certificates and keys.

1. **Verify Certificate against the Certificate Chain Bundle**

   ```bash
   print_section_header "Verify ${file_name} Certificate against the ${file_name} Certificate Chain Bundle"
   openssl verify -CAfile "$certificates_dir/certs/${file_name}_chain_bundle.pem" "$certificates_dir/certs/${file_name}.pem"
   ```

    <br />

2. **Verify Certificate against the Intermediate Certificate Authority Chain
   Bundle**

   ```bash
   print_section_header "Verify ${file_name} Certificate against the Intermediate Certificate Authority Chain Bundle"
   openssl verify -CAfile "$intermediate_dir/certs/ca_chain_bundle.pem" "$certificates_dir/certs/${file_name}.pem"
   ```

    <br />

3. **Verify Certificate Chain Bundle against the Intermediate Certificate
   Authority Chain Bundle**

   ```bash
   print_section_header "Verify ${file_name} Certificate Chain Bundle against the Intermediate Certificate Authority Chain Bundle"
   openssl verify -CAfile "$intermediate_dir/certs/ca_chain_bundle.pem" "$certificates_dir/certs/${file_name}_chain_bundle.pem"
   ```

<br />

### Check Generated Files

The script includes steps to check the private key, CSR, client certificate, and
the chain bundle to verify their contents.

1. **Check Private Key**

   ```bash
   print_section_header "Check Private Key"
   openssl ecparam -in "$certificates_dir/private/${file_name}.pem" -text -noout
   ```

    <br />

2. **Check CSR**

   ```bash
   print_section_header "Check Certificate Signing Request (CSR)"
   openssl req -text -noout -verify -in "$certificates_dir/csr/${file_name}.pem"
   ```

    <br />

3. **Check Certificate**

   ```bash
   print_section_header "Check Certificate"
   openssl x509 -in "$certificates_dir/certs/${file_name}.pem" -text -noout
   ```

    <br />

4. **Check Certificate Chain Bundle**

   ```bash
   print_section_header "Check Certificate Chain Bundle"
   openssl x509 -in "$certificates_dir/certs/${file_name}_chain_bundle.pem" -text -noout
   ```

<br />

### Convert Certificate to Different Formats

The script converts the certificate from PEM to CRT and KEY formats for
compatibility with various applications.

```bash
print_section_header "Convert Certificate from ${fqdn}.pem to"
cat "$certificates_dir/certs/${file_name}.pem" >"$certificates_dir/certs/${file_name}.crt"
cat "$certificates_dir/certs/${file_name}_chain_bundle.pem" >"$certificates_dir/certs/${file_name}_chain_bundle.crt"
cat "$certificates_dir/private/${file_name}.pem" >"$certificates_dir/private/${file_name}.key"
chmod 600 "$certificates_dir/private/${file_name}.key"
echo -e "$(print_cyan "--> ")""${fqdn}.crt"
echo -e "$(print_cyan "--> ")""${fqdn}_chain_bundle.crt"
echo -e "$(print_cyan "--> ")""${fqdn}.key"
```

<br />

## Conclusion

This script ensures that every step in generating and managing an ECDSA client
certificate is performed correctly and securely, from key generation to
certificate verification and format conversion.
