Let's break down what this script does in detail. The script is named
`openssl_installer.sh`, authored by GJS (homelab-alpha), and its purpose is to
add specific configuration content to the `~/.bashrc` file without duplicating
existing entries. This ensures that certain aliases or configurations are loaded
from a separate file.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

## Script Metadata

- **Filename**: `openssl_installer.sh`
- **Author**: GJS (homelab-alpha)
- **Date**: June 5, 2024
- **Version**: 1.0.1
- **Description**: The script adds specified content to the `~/.bashrc` file,
  ensuring that it avoids duplication. If `~/.bashrc` exists, it appends the
  necessary content to the end only if it doesn't already exist.
- **RAW Script**: [openssl_installer.sh]

<br />

## Detailed Explanation

### BASHRC_PATH and ALIASES_PATH Variables

```bash
BASHRC_PATH="$HOME/.bashrc"
ALIASES_PATH="$HOME/openssl/dotfiles/.bash_aliases"
```

- `BASHRC_PATH` is set to the path of the user's `.bashrc` file.
- `ALIASES_PATH` is set to the path where the alias definitions are stored
  (`.bash_aliases`).

<br />

### Checking for Existing Configuration

```bash
if ! grep -qF "if [ -f $ALIASES_PATH ]; then" "$BASHRC_PATH"; then
```

- This `if` statement uses `grep` to check if the string
  `if [ -f $ALIASES_PATH ]; then` is already present in the `.bashrc` file.
- The `-qF` flags ensure that `grep` searches for a fixed string (`-F`) quietly
  (`-q`), meaning it won't produce any output but will set the exit status.

<br />

### Appending Configuration to .bashrc

```bash
{
    echo "# Alias definitions for openssl."
    echo "# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like"
    echo "# ~/openssl/dotfiles/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly."
    echo ""
    echo "if [ -f $ALIASES_PATH ]; then"
    echo "    . $ALIASES_PATH"
    echo "fi"
    echo ""
} >>"$BASHRC_PATH"
```

- If the specific configuration string is not found in the `.bashrc`, a block of
  text is appended to the file.
- This block includes:
  - A comment explaining that alias definitions are for `openssl`.
  - A recommendation to put additions in a separate file (`.bash_aliases`).
  - The conditional inclusion of `.bash_aliases` if it exists.

<br />

### Completion Message

```bash
echo "Installation completed. .bashrc has been updated and the shell has been restarted."
```

- Prints a message indicating that the `.bashrc` file has been updated
  successfully.

<br />

### Exit the Script

```bash
exit
```

- Exits the script.

<br />

## Conclusion

In summary, `openssl_installer.sh` ensures that the user's `.bashrc` file is
updated to source a separate aliases file (`.bash_aliases`) if it exists, and it
does so without adding duplicate entries. This makes managing shell aliases
cleaner and more modular.
