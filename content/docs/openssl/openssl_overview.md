## Introduction

OpenSSL is a widely-used open-source cryptographic library that provides various
tools, libraries, and protocols for secure communication over computer networks.
It supports various encryption algorithms, cryptographic hash functions, and
protocols, making it a versatile tool for securing data transmission and
ensuring data integrity.

<br />

## Self-signed certificates

{{% alert context="primary" %}}
The scripts has been upgraded to full Elliptic Curve P-384 (secp384r1)
for Trusted-ID, Root CA, Sub CA and all Certs scripts. If there are any issues
with any certificate or script [Please let me know], I thank you in advance.
{{% /alert %}}

This repository provides scripts and configuration files for generating and
verifying Self-signed certificates using OpenSSL. These certificates are useful
for testing or internal use but may not be suitable for production environments
requiring third-party validation.

<br />

## Samples

In this repository you will find a folder called samples. In this folder you can
see how the folder structure with the associated certificates and files is
created. However, I removed the certificates and private keys and replaced them
with a placeholders to prevent the sample certificates from being used.

## Contribute to Homelab-Alpha - OpenSSL

We value your contribution. We want to make it as easy as possible to submit
your contributions to the Homelab-Alpha - openssl repository. Changes to the
openssl are handled through pull requests against the `main` branch. To learn
how to contribute, see [contribute].

## Security Considerations

While OpenSSL provides powerful cryptographic functions, it's essential to
follow best practices and keep the library updated to address any security
vulnerabilities. Regularly check for updates and security advisories from the
OpenSSL project.
