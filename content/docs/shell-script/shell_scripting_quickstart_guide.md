## Introduction to Shell Scripting

Shell scripting is a powerful tool that allows you to automate tasks, manipulate
files, and streamline your workflow by executing a series of commands in a
script file. It acts as a bridge between you and the operating system, making
repetitive tasks easier and faster.

<br />

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Environment

Before you dive into writing shell scripts, you'll need to set up your
environment:

1. **Choose a Shell**: The most common shell is `bash` (Bourne Again Shell), but
   other shells like `sh`, `zsh`, and `ksh` are also widely used.
2. **Text Editor**: Use a text editor to write your scripts. Popular choices
   include `vim`, `nano`, and `VSCode`.
3. **Terminal Access**: Ensure you have access to a terminal. If you're on macOS
   or Linux, you already have one. Windows users can use tools like Git Bash,
   WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), or Cygwin.

<br />

### Basic Commands

Here are some basic commands you'll frequently use in shell scripting:

- `echo`: Prints text to the terminal.
- `cd`: Changes the current directory.
- `ls`: Lists files and directories.
- `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
- `mkdir`: Creates a new directory.
- `rm`: Removes files or directories.

<br />

## Writing Your First Script

Let's write a simple script to get you started:

1. **Create a new file**:

   ```sh
   touch myscript.sh
   ```

2. Open the file in your text editor and add the following lines:

   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello, World!"
   ```

3. Make the script executable:

   ```sh
   chmod +x myscript.sh
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./myscript.sh
   ```

You should see the output Hello, World! in your terminal.

<br />

## Common Shell Script Commands

Here are some more commands and concepts that are essential for shell scripting:

- Variables: Store values for reuse.

```sh
name="Alice"
echo "Hello, $name"
```

- Loops: Repeat commands multiple times.

```sh
for i in {1..5}
do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
```

- Conditionals: Make decisions based on conditions

```sh
if [ $name == "Alice" ]; then
  echo "Hello, Alice"
else
  echo "You are not Alice"
fi
```

- Functions: Group commands into reusable blocks.

```sh
greet() {
  echo "Hello, $1"
}
greet "Bob"
```

<br />

## Shell Script Examples

### Example 1: Backup Script

This script backs up a directory to a specified location:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/source"
BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backup"

if [ -d "$SOURCE_DIR" ]; then
  tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz" "$SOURCE_DIR"
  echo "Backup completed successfully."
else
  echo "Source directory does not exist."
fi
```

<br />

### Example 2: User Management Script

This script adds a new user to the system:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter username: " username
sudo useradd -m "$username"
echo "User $username has been added."
```

<br />

## Advanced Topics

Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can explore more advanced topics
such as:

- Error Handling: Implementing robust error checks to handle unexpected
  situations.
- Logging: Keeping a log of your script's actions for debugging and auditing.
- Debugging: Using tools like set -x to trace your script's execution.
- Scripting Best Practices: Writing clean, maintainable, and efficient scripts.
