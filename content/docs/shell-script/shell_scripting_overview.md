## Introduction

Shell script are plain text files containing commands that are interpreted and
executed by the shell. They are commonly used for automating tasks, managing
system configurations, and performing various operations in Unix-like operating
systems.

<br />

## Usage

Each shell script in this repository is self-contained and can be run directly
from the command-line. Before executing a script, ensure that you have the
necessary permissions and dependencies installed on your system.

To run a shell script, navigate to its location in the terminal and execute the
following command:

```bash
./script_name.sh
```

Replace `script_name.sh` with the name of the script you want to run.
