Let's break down what this script does in detail. The script is named
`maintain_git_repo.sh`, authored by GJS (homelab-alpha), and its purpose is to
automate the maintenance of a Git repository by cleaning up unnecessary files
and resetting the commit history to provide a fresh start. This can be useful
after importing from another version control system or to ensure a clean history
for better project management and collaboration.

Here's a detailed explanation:

## Script Metadata

- **Filename**: `maintain_git_repo.sh`
- **Author**: GJS (homelab-alpha)
- **Date**: May 18, 2024
- **Version**: 1.0.1
- **Description**: The script automates the process of cleaning up a Git
  repository by removing unnecessary files and resetting the commit history.
  This helps in organizing the repository and reducing its size.
- **RAW Script**: [maintain_git_repo.sh]

<br />

## Description

The script is designed to streamline the process of cleaning up a Git
repository. It creates a new branch without the previous commit history, adds
all files to this new branch, and then replaces the old main branch with this
new clean branch. The result is a repository with a single, clean commit, which
can help in managing the repository more effectively.

<br />

## Create a New Branch Without History

```sh
git checkout --orphan cleaned-history
```

This command creates a new branch called `cleaned-history` without any commit
history. This is useful for starting fresh without bringing over the old commit
history.

<br />

## Add All Files to the Staging Area

```sh
git add -A
```

This command stages all files in the repository, preparing them for the next
commit.

<br />

## Make an Initial Commit

```sh
git commit -am "maintenance: New start, a clean history"
```

This commits all staged files with a message indicating that this is a
maintenance action to start with a clean history.

<br />

## Delete the Old `main` Branch

```sh
git branch -D main
```

This command deletes the old `main` branch. This step is necessary to replace
the old branch with the new one.

<br />

## Rename the Current Branch to `main`

```sh
git branch -m main
```

This renames the current branch (previously `cleaned-history`) to `main`, making
it the new main branch of the repository.

<br />

## Push the New `main` Branch to the Remote Repository

```sh
git push -f origin main
```

This forcefully pushes the new `main` branch to the remote repository, replacing
the old `main` branch. The `-f` (force) option is necessary because the
histories of the branches do not match.

<br />

## Close the Terminal

```sh
exit 0
```

This command closes the terminal session. The script ends here.

<br />

## Example Usage

Suppose you have a Git repository with accumulated unnecessary files or a messy
commit history. You can use this script to clean up the repository and start
fresh. Hereâ€™s how you would use it:

1. Navigate to your Git repository directory.
2. Execute the script by running `./maintain_git_repo.sh`.
3. Review the changes to ensure everything is as expected.
4. Push the changes to your remote repository.
5. Inform your team members about the maintenance activity to avoid any
   conflicts or misunderstandings.

<br />

## Conclusion

This script provides an efficient way to clean up a Git repository by resetting
its history and organizing its structure. It is particularly useful for
maintaining a clear and concise project history, which can enhance collaboration
and project management.
