## Taking a Percentage of a Number

The formula to calculate a percentage of a number is given by:

$
\text{Result} = \frac{p \times v}{100}
$

Where \( p \) is the percentage and \( v \) is the value. For example, to
calculate 20% of 50:

$
\text{Result} = \frac{20 \times 50}{100} = 10
$

How to calculate it on a calculator:

$ \ p \times v \div 100 \$

---

<br />

## Increasing a Number by a Certain Percentage

To increase a number by a certain percentage:

$
\text{Result} = v + \left(\frac{p}{100} \times v\right)
$

Where \( p \) is the percentage and \( v \) is the value. For example, to
increase 50 by 20%:

$
\text{Result} = 50 + \left(\frac{20}{100} \times 50\right) = 50 + 10 = 60
$

How to calculate it on a calculator:

$ \ v + (p \times v \div 100) \ $

---

<br />

## Decreasing a Number by a Certain Percentage

To decrease a number by a certain percentage:

$
\text{Result} = v - \left(\frac{p}{100} \times v\right)
$

Where \( p \) is the percentage and \( v \) is the value. For example, to
decrease 50 by 20%:

$
\text{Result} = 50 - \left(\frac{20}{100} \times 50\right) = 50 - 10 = 40
$

How to calculate it on a calculator:

$ \ v - (p \times v \div 100) \ $

## Calculating What Percentage One Number Is of Another

To calculate what percentage one number is of another number:

$
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{v1 \times 100}{v2}\right)
$

Where \( v1 \) is the first value and \( v2 \) is the second value. For example,
what percentage is 20 of 50:

$
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{20 \times 100}{50}\right) = 40\%
$

How to calculate it on a calculator:

$ \ v1 \times 100 \div v2 \ $

---

<br />

## Calculating the Percentage Difference

To calculate the percentage difference between two numbers:

$
\text{Percentage Difference} = \left(\frac{v2 - v1}{v1}\right) \times 100
$

Where \( v1 \) is the first value and \( v2 \) is the second value. For example,
to calculate the percentage difference between 20 and 50:

$
\text{Percentage Difference} = \left(\frac{50 - 20}{20}\right) \times 100 =
\left(\frac{30}{20}\right) \times 100 = 150\%
$

How to calculate it on a calculator:

$ \ (v2 - v1) \div v1 \times 100 \ $
