## Environment Variables

This file contains configuration settings that can be used by various
applications (such as Docker containers or your MariaDB server). The values are
variables stored outside the source code for security purposes.

<br />

### Variables in this file

```env
# Database Configuration: ROOT USER
# Change the MariaDB root password to a strong, unique password of your choice.
# Ensure the password is complex and not easily guessable.
ROOT_PASSWORD_DB=StrongUniqueRootPassword1234

# Database Configuration: USER
# Database host and connection settings
HOST_DB=mariadb_db

# Database name: Change this to your desired database name
NAME_DB=mariadb_db

# MariaDB user password: Change this to a strong, unique password
PASSWORD_DB=StrongUniqueUserPassword5678

# MariaDB connection port (default: 3306)
PORT_DB=3306

# MariaDB username: Change this to your desired username
USER_DB=mariadb
```

- **`ROOT_PASSWORD_DB`**: The password for the root user of the MariaDB database.
  This account has full access to all databases. Make sure this password is
  strong, unique, and complex to prevent unauthorized access.
- **HOST_DB**: The name or IP address of the host where the database is running.
  In this case, itâ€™s `mariadb_db`, which could refer to the name of a database
  container or network, possibly for a MariaDB service.
- **NAME_DB**: The name of the database being used. Here, it's `mariadb_db`,
  which is probably the database related to a MariaDB instance.
- **PASSWORD_DB**: The password for the `mariadb` user. As with the root
  password, make sure this password is strong and unique to secure access to the
  database.
- **PORT_DB**: The port MariaDB is listening on. The default port is `3306` unless
  configured otherwise.
- **USER_DB**: The username for accessing the database. In this case, itâ€™s
  `mariadb`.

<br />

## MariaDB/MySQL Configuration

This file contains configuration settings for the MariaDB/MySQL server. It
determines how the database behaves, such as connection settings, performance,
and security.

<br />

### Sections in this file

```cnf
[mysqld]
# ============================================
# General Server Settings
# ============================================
server-id = 1
datadir = /var/lib/mysql/
pid-file = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
skip-name-resolve
default-storage-engine = InnoDB
transaction-isolation = REPEATABLE-READ
skip-symbolic-links
```

- **server-id**: This is a unique ID for the server, important if you want to
  set up replication with MariaDB/MySQL. Itâ€™s set to `1` here.
- **datadir**: The directory where the database files are stored on disk.
- **pid-file**: This file holds the process ID of the running MySQL server.
- **skip-name-resolve**: This prevents DNS resolution for client connections,
  improving connection speed.
- **default-storage-engine**: The default storage engine for new tables, set to
  `InnoDB`, which is ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,
  Durability).
- **transaction-isolation**: The isolation level for transactions, set to
  `REPEATABLE-READ` (a common default in MySQL).
- **skip-symbolic-links**: Prevents the use of symbolic links, enhancing data
  security.

<br />

```cnf
# ============================================
# Performance Optimizations
# ============================================
innodb-buffer-pool-size-auto-min = 0
innodb-log-file-size = 1G
innodb-log-buffer-size = 32M
innodb-flush-log-at-trx-commit = 1
innodb-read-io-threads = 8
innodb-write-io-threads = 8
```

- **innodb-buffer-pool-size-auto-min**: Minimum InnoDB buffer pool size when
  auto-shrinking under memory pressure. Shrinks pool halfway between current
  size and this value. 0 = no minimum.
- **innodb-log-file-size**: The size of the InnoDB redo log files. Larger log
  files can improve performance for write-heavy workloads.
- **innodb-log-buffer-size**: The size of the memory buffer for the InnoDB log
  files. Larger buffers reduce disk I/O.
- **innodb-flush-log-at-trx-commit**: Ensures that logs are written to disk with
  each transaction commit, providing ACID guarantees, though it can impact
  performance.
- **innodb-read-io-threads and innodb-write-io-threads**: The number of threads
  InnoDB uses for read and write operations. These can improve performance for
  high I/O workloads.

<br />

```cnf
# ============================================
# Binary Logging and Replication
# ============================================
log-bin = mariadb_binlog
max-binlog-size = 500M
expire-logs-days = 7
binlog-format = ROW
```

- **log-bin**: Enables binary logging, which is needed for replication and
  point-in-time recovery. The log will be stored as `mariadb_binlog`.
- **max-binlog-size**: The maximum size for each binary log file. A new log file
  is created when this limit is reached (500MB in this case).
- **expire-logs-days**: The number of days after which binary logs will be
  automatically purged. Here, itâ€™s set to 7 days to save disk space.
- **binlog-format**: The format for binary logging, set to `ROW`, which ensures
  data consistency for replication.

<br />

```cnf
# ============================================
# Character Set and Encoding
# ============================================
character-set-server = utf8mb4
collation-server = utf8mb4_general_ci
```

- **character-set-server** and **collation-server**: These settings ensure that
  the database uses UTF-8 encoding by default, which is important for
  international support. `utf8mb4` supports a wider range of characters than the
  older `utf8` encoding.

<br />

```cnf
# ============================================
# SSL/TLS Security
# ============================================
# ssl-ca = /etc/mysql/ssl/ca-cert.pem
# ssl-cert = /etc/mysql/ssl/server-cert.pem
# ssl-key = /etc/mysql/ssl/server-key.pem
# require-secure-transport = 1
```

- **SSL/TLS settings**: These settings enable SSL certificates for encrypted
  connections. It's disabled (commented out), but can be configured for added
  security.

<br />

## Conclusion

This `docker-compose.yml` file sets up a MariaDB instance, defining a custom
network for isolation and secure communication. The MariaDB container is
configured with persistent storage, environment variables for database
credentials, and health check configurations to ensure its availability. The
setup ensures secure and efficient database management with proper logging and
restart policies.
