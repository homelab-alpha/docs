## Introduction

How cool that you've discovered our Docker projects! Here you'll find everything
you need to smoothly run your Docker projects with Docker and Docker Compose.

Our main goal is to make setting up your Docker projects effortless. By
containerizing the application components with Docker, we aim for consistency
across different environments and simplify dependency management.

So, let us help you enhance your development experience and quickly set up your
projects with Docker and Docker Compose!

<br />

## What is Docker?

[Docker] is a platform used to develop, deploy, and run applications in
containers. A container is a stand-alone, executable software package that
contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including code, runtime,
libraries, system tools, and settings.

With Docker, developers can build, share, and run containers across different
environments, regardless of the infrastructure. This ensures consistent
operation of software no matter where it's run.

<br />

## What is Docker Compose?

[Docker Compose] is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker
applications. With Compose, you can easily create a YAML file to configure your
app's services, networks, and volumes, allowing you to start your entire app
with just a few commands.

<br />

### Basic Usage

To start a simple container, use the following Docker commands:

```bash
# Pull the latest image from Docker Hub
docker pull image_name

# Start a container
docker run image_name
```

For using Docker Compose, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with your app's
configuration and then run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start all services as specified in the YAML file.

<br />

## Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text file with instructions that tell Docker how to build a
Docker image. It allows you to specify your application's configuration and
dependencies.

Here's an example of a simple Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Use a base image
FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Install necessary packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    package1 \
    package2

# Copy local source code to the container
COPY . /app

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Run command when starting the container
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

<br />

## Docker Compose File

A Docker Compose file is a YAML file that defines the services, networks, and
volumes for your application. It allows you to orchestrate multiple containers
to work together as one application.

Here's an example of a simple Docker Compose file:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
```

## FAQs

**What's the difference between Docker and Docker Compose?**\
Docker is a platform for running containers, while Docker Compose is a tool for defining
and running multi-container Docker applications.

**Can I use Docker on Windows and macOS?**\
Yes, Docker Desktop provides support for both Windows, macOS and Linux.

**How can I create my own Docker image?**\
You can create your own Docker image by writing a Dockerfile that defines your application's
configuration and dependencies.
