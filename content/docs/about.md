## Who is Homelab-Alpha?

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Homelab-Alpha website! I'm GJS, a tech enthusiast with a passion
for technology, automation, and problem-solving. My homelab is my playground,
where I experiment with new technologies, test different configurations, and
continuously seek ways to make my environment smarter and more efficient.

I'm passionate about open-source, self-hosting, and making technology accessible
to everyone. Whether it's streamlining deployments, securing environments, or
optimizing performance, I'm always looking for new solutions.

I thrive on solving complex challenges, automating processes, and exploring
cutting-edge technology. Whether Iâ€™m discovering new gadgets or tackling
advanced technical projects, Iâ€™m at my best when Iâ€™m tinkering.

My repositories focus on automation, security, and system optimization. From
Dockerized applications to OpenSSL integrations and monitoring tools like Uptime
Kuma each project is designed to enhance self-hosted environments. Check out my
latest contributions and feel free to collaborate!

<br />

## Who is Homelab-Alpha for?

Homelab-Alpha is a project dedicated to creating and managing a home laboratory
environment for personal and educational purposes. It aims to provide a platform
for experimenting with various technologies and learning new skills in a
hands-on environment.

<br />

## My Open Source Repositories

- **[Docker]:** Explore the world of containerization with Docker and Docker
  Compose. These powerful tools package, distribute, and manage containerized
  applications.
- **[OpenSSL]:** Generate self-signed certificates suitable for your homelab
  environment, primarily for testing purposes. Avoid for production use.
- **[Shell Script]:** Unlock the power of shell scripting to simplify complex
  tasks, automate processes, enhance efficiency, and boost productivity.
- **[Uptime Kuma]** (a fork of [louislam/uptime-kuma])**:** A self-hosted
  monitoring tool that allows you to monitor uptime, status, and notifications
  for various services and domains.
