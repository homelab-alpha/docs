## How to Calculate Speed?

1. **Note the distance covered in meters** (for example, 1000 meters for 1.0
   kilometer).
2. **Measure the time taken in minutes and seconds** (for example, 12 minutes 30
   seconds for a speed of 4.8 km/h).
3. **Use the table below to easily estimate the speed** based on the time per
   kilometer.

| **Time per Kilometer** | **Speed (km/h)** | **Speed (mph)** | **Description**                        |
