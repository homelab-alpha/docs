<br />

## Amending the Last Commit

You can amend the last commit with new changes:

```bash
git commit --amend
```

<br />

## Stashing Changes

Stash changes to temporarily store them:

```bash
git stash
```

<br />

## Cherry-picking Commits

Apply a specific commit from one branch to another:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

<br />

## Interactive Rebasing

Rewrite commit history interactively:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Rebase last 3 commits
```

<br />

## Viewing Diffs

View the differences between two commits:

```bash
git diff <commit1> <commit2>
```

<br />

## Creating Aliases

Create shortcuts for Git commands:

```bash
git config --global alias.co checkout
```

<br />

## Git Bisect

Find the commit that introduced a bug:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad            # Current commit is bad
git bisect good <commit>  # Known good commit
```

<br />

## Squashing Commits

Combine multiple commits into one:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Squash last 3 commits
```

<br />

## Git Hooks

Automate tasks by using Git hooks:

```bash
# Create a pre-commit hook
touch .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

<br />

## Git Worktrees

Work on multiple branches simultaneously:

```bash
git worktree add <path> <branch>
```

<br />

## Git Submodules

Include other Git repositories within your own:

```bash
git submodule add <repository-url>
```

<br />

## Reflog

Recover lost commits using reflog:

```bash
git reflog
git checkout HEAD@{1}  # Restore commit from reflog
```

<br />

## Gitignore Patterns

Exclude files from version control:

```bash
# Add a pattern to .gitignore
echo '*.log' >> .gitignore
```

<br />

## Git Bisect with Script

Use a script to automate bisecting:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good $(git bisect-script)
```
