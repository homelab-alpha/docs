## Introduction

The **SQ3R Reading Method** is a proven technique designed to enhance
comprehension and retention of written material. Developed by educational
psychologist Francis P. Robinson in the 1940s, this method breaks the reading
process into five structured steps: Survey, Question, Read, Retrieve, and
Review. Unlike passive reading, where the reader simply moves through the text,
the SQ3R method encourages active engagement by prompting the reader to
question, summarize, and recall key information. By following this approach,
learners can improve their understanding of complex material, solidify long-term
memory, and make more efficient use of their study time.

Whether you're tackling a textbook, preparing for an exam, or simply seeking to
deepen your understanding of a subject, the SQ3R method provides a systematic
framework that makes reading a more focused and productive experience.

The **SQ3R** method, also known as **SQRRR**, is a reading comprehension
technique named for its five steps:

- Survey
- Question
- Read
- Retrieve
- Review

<br />

### 1. Survey (S)

The first step, **Survey** or **Skim**, advises that one should resist the
temptation to read the text and instead first go through a chapter, noting
headings, subheadings, and other standout features such as figures, tables,
marginal information, and summary paragraphs. This survey step typically takes
only 3–5 minutes but provides an outline or framework for what will be
presented. The reader should identify ideas and formulate questions about the
chapter’s content.

<br />

### 2. Question (Q)

Generate questions about the content of the reading. For example, convert
headings and subheadings into questions and then look for answers in the text.
Other, more general questions may also be formulated, such as:

- What is this chapter about?
- What question is this chapter trying to answer?
- How does this information help me?

<br />

### 3. Read (R1)

Use the background work done in steps **S** and **Q** to start reading actively.
This means reading with the purpose of answering the questions raised in **Q**.
Passive reading, on the other hand, results in simply going through the material
without engaging with it.

<br />

### 4. Retrieve (R2)

The second **R** refers to **Retrieve**. The reader should attempt to retrieve
from memory what was learned, as though explaining it to someone else. It’s
essential for the reader to use their own words to conceptualize and express the
material. Try recalling key points (headings/subheadings) and answers to the
questions from the **Q** step. This retrieval can be done either orally or in
written form, and it relates to the **testing effect**, which enhances long-term
retention.

<br />

### 5. Review (R3)

The final **R** is **Review**. After finishing the passage, review the material
by summarizing the main points in your own words. You can then repeat the
process for the second set of questions.
