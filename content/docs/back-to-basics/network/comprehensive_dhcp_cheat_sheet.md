## Overview

This cheat sheet provides a detailed guide on DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol), covering the essentials, configuration steps, message types, common
options, troubleshooting tips, and advanced topics like relay and failover.

<br />

## What is DHCP?

DHCP is a network management protocol used to automate the process of
configuring devices on IP networks. It assigns IP addresses and other network
configuration parameters to devices, allowing them to communicate on a network.

<br />

## Key Terms

- **DHCP Server**: A server that manages and assigns IP addresses.
- **DHCP Client**: A device that receives an IP address from a DHCP server.
- **IP Address**: A unique identifier for a device on a network.
- **Lease**: The duration of time a DHCP client can use an IP address before it
  must be renewed.
- **Scope**: The range of IP addresses that a DHCP server can assign to clients.
- **Subnet Mask**: Used to divide an IP address into network and host portions.
- **Default Gateway**: The IP address of a router that forwards traffic to other
  networks.
- **DNS Server**: A server that translates domain names to IP addresses.

<br />

## DHCP Process (DORA)

1. **Discovery**: The client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message to find available
   DHCP servers.
2. **Offer**: DHCP servers respond with a DHCPOFFER message, offering an IP
   address.
3. **Request**: The client sends a DHCPREQUEST message to the selected DHCP
   server, requesting the offered IP address.
4. **Acknowledgment**: The DHCP server sends a DHCPACK message, confirming the
   lease of the IP address.

<br />

## DHCP Message Types

- **DHCPDISCOVER**: Sent by clients to locate available DHCP servers.
- **DHCPOFFER**: Sent by servers in response to a DHCPDISCOVER, offering an IP
  address.
- **DHCPREQUEST**: Sent by clients to accept an offered IP address.
- **DHCPACK**: Sent by servers to confirm the IP address lease.
- **DHCPNAK**: Sent by servers if the client's request cannot be fulfilled.
- **DHCPDECLINE**: Sent by clients if the offered IP address is already in use.
- **DHCPRELEASE**: Sent by clients to release an assigned IP address.
- **DHCPINFORM**: Sent by clients to obtain local configuration parameters
  without IP address allocation.

<br />

## Common DHCP Options

- **Option 1**: Subnet Mask
- **Option 3**: Default Gateway
- **Option 6**: DNS Server
- **Option 12**: Hostname
- **Option 15**: Domain Name
- **Option 51**: IP Address Lease Time
- **Option 53**: DHCP Message Type
- **Option 54**: DHCP Server Identifier
- **Option 61**: Client Identifier

<br />

## DHCP Configuration Example (Linux ISC DHCP Server)

### Install DHCP Server

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
```

<br />

### Configuration File: `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`

```bash
# Global Parameters
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;
authoritative;

# Network Configuration
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.200;
  option routers 192.168.1.1;
  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
  option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;
  option domain-name "example.com";
}
```

<br />

### Restart DHCP Server

```bash
sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
```

<br />

## Troubleshooting DHCP

- **Check DHCP Server Status**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
  ```
- **View DHCP Leases**:
  ```bash
  cat /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
  ```
- **Check for DHCP Messages**:
  ```bash
  sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep dhcp
  ```
- **Renew IP Address (Client)**:
  ```bash
  sudo dhclient -r
  sudo dhclient
  ```

<br />

## Best Practices

1. **Plan IP Addressing Scheme**: Carefully design the IP address ranges to
   avoid conflicts.
2. **Secure DHCP Server**: Limit access and monitor for unauthorized devices.
3. **Regular Backups**: Keep backups of the DHCP configuration and lease files.
4. **Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools to track the DHCP server's health and
   performance.
5. **Lease Time Management**: Adjust lease times according to network needs to
   optimize address availability.

<br />

## Security Practices

Securing your DHCP infrastructure is crucial to maintaining a safe and efficient
network. Here are some security practices to consider:

1. **Isolate the DHCP Server**: Place the DHCP server on a dedicated network
  segment to limit access.
2. **Use DHCP Snooping**: Enable DHCP snooping on your network switches to
  prevent rogue DHCP servers from distributing IP addresses.
3. **Authentication**: Implement 802.1X network access control to ensure only
  authenticated devices receive IP addresses.
4. **Monitor DHCP Traffic**: Use network monitoring tools to keep an eye on DHCP
  traffic and identify unusual activity.
5. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Apply ACLs to restrict which devices can send
  or receive DHCP traffic.
6. **Regular Updates**: Keep the DHCP server software updated to protect against
  known vulnerabilities.

<br />

## Advanced Topics

### DHCP Relay

When clients and DHCP servers are on different subnets, a DHCP relay agent
forwards DHCP messages between them.

<br />

### Configuring DHCP Relay (Linux)

```bash
sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-relay

# Configuration File: /etc/default/isc-dhcp-relay
SERVERS="192.168.1.10" # IP of the DHCP Server
INTERFACES="eth0 eth1" # Interfaces to listen on

sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-relay
```

<br />

### DHCP Failover

To provide high availability, you can configure two DHCP servers in failover
mode. They share lease information and balance load.

<br />

### Configuring DHCP Failover (ISC DHCP Server)

In `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`:

```bash
# On Primary DHCP Server
failover peer "dhcp-failover" {
  primary;
  address 192.168.1.10;
  port 647;
  peer address 192.168.1.11;
  peer port 647;
  max-response-delay 60;
  max-unacked-updates 10;
  load balance max seconds 3;
  mclt 3600;
  split 128;
}

# On Secondary DHCP Server
failover peer "dhcp-failover" {
  secondary;
  address 192.168.1.11;
  port 647;
  peer address 192.168.1.10;
  peer port 647;
  max-response-delay 60;
  max-unacked-updates 10;
  load balance max seconds 3;
}
```

<br />

## Real-world Scenarios

Here are some scenarios where DHCP troubleshooting and best practices come into
play:

### Scenario 1: IP Address Exhaustion

- **Problem**: Users report that they cannot connect to the network.
- **Solution**: Check the DHCP scope to ensure there are enough IP addresses
  available. Adjust the range if necessary or reduce the lease time to recycle
  addresses more frequently.

<br />

### Scenario 2: Rogue DHCP Server

- **Problem**: Devices are getting incorrect IP addresses or network
  configurations.
- **Solution**: Enable DHCP snooping on switches to block unauthorized DHCP
  servers. Identify and remove the rogue server.

<br />

### Scenario 3: Network Segmentation

- **Problem**: Devices on different subnets are not receiving IP addresses.
- **Solution**: Configure a DHCP relay agent to forward requests between
  subnets. Ensure proper relay configuration and connectivity.

<br />

### Scenario 4: Lease Renewal Issues

- **Problem**: Devices are losing connectivity periodically.
- **Solution**: Check the DHCP server logs for errors during lease renewals.
  Adjust the lease time and ensure the server has adequate resources to handle
  renewals.

<br />

### Scenario 5: Misconfigured DHCP Options

- **Problem**: Devices are not receiving the correct DNS server addresses.
- **Solution**: Verify the DHCP configuration file for correct option settings.
  Use `option domain-name-servers` to specify the correct DNS servers.

<br />
