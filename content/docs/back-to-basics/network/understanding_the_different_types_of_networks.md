- High data transfer speeds.
- Secure within the localized area.
- Easy resource sharing.

### Cons

- Limited to a small geographical area.
- Setup and maintenance costs.

<br />

## Campus Area Network (CAN)

### Overview

- **Definition**: A network that covers a campus, typically a university or
  business campus.
- **Range**: Limited to the geographical area of the campus.
- **Devices**: Computers, printers, routers, switches.

### Key Features

- **Purpose**: Connecting multiple LANs within a limited geographical area.
- **Communication**: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
- **Example**: A network connecting all buildings within a university campus.

### Pros

- High-speed connectivity.
- Centralized control over the entire network.

### Cons

- Requires significant infrastructure investment.
- Maintenance can be complex.

<br />

## Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

### Overview

- **Definition**: A network that spans a city or a large campus.
- **Range**: Typically up to 50 kilometers.
- **Devices**: Routers, switches, modems.

### Key Features

- **Purpose**: Connecting multiple LANs within a metropolitan area.
- **Communication**: Fiber optics, wireless links.
- **Example**: A network connecting different branches of a university across a
  city.

### Pros

- Covers larger area than LAN.
- Efficient resource sharing within the metropolitan area.

### Cons

- More expensive than LAN.
- Requires more infrastructure and maintenance.

<br />

## Wide Area Network (WAN)

### Overview

- **Definition**: A network that covers a broad area (e.g., any network whose
  communications links cross metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries).
- **Range**: Can span cities, countries, or even continents.
- **Devices**: Routers, switches, modems, satellites, etc.

### Key Features

- **Purpose**: Connecting LANs and other types of networks to allow
  communication and data transfer across large distances.
- **Communication**: Fiber optics, leased lines, satellite links.
- **Example**: The internet, which connects millions of LANs worldwide.

### Pros

- Large coverage area.
- Enables long-distance communication.

### Cons

- High setup and operational costs.
- Slower data transfer speeds compared to LAN.

<br />

## Storage Area Network (SAN)

### Overview

- **Definition**: A high-speed network that provides access to consolidated,
  block-level data storage.
- **Range**: Typically confined to a data center or extended across multiple
  data centers.
- **Devices**: Disk arrays, tape libraries, SAN switches.

### Key Features

- **Purpose**: Enhancing the accessibility and management of storage devices.
- **Communication**: Fibre Channel, iSCSI.
- **Example**: A SAN used in an enterprise data center for centralized storage
  management.

### Pros

- High-speed data transfer.
- Efficient storage management.
- Scalability.

### Cons

- High cost.
- Requires specialized knowledge for setup and management.

<br />

## Enterprise Private Network (EPN)

### Overview

  various locations securely.
- **Range**: Varies depending on the locations of the enterprise offices.
- **Devices**: Routers, switches, private communication lines.

### Key Features

- **Purpose**: Ensuring secure and efficient communication between different
  parts of an enterprise.
- **Communication**: Private leased lines, MPLS.
- **Example**: A large corporation connecting its global offices with a private
  network.

### Pros

- High security.
- Reliable and controlled performance.

### Cons

- Expensive to set up and maintain.
