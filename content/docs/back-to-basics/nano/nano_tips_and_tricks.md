## Persistent Undo

Enable Nano's persistent undo feature to undo changes even after saving and
closing the file. Add `set undo` to your `.nanorc` configuration file.

<br />

## Automatic Indentation

Nano can automatically indent lines based on the syntax of the file. Enable it
with `set autoindent` in your `.nanorc`.

<br />

## Syntax Highlighting Customization

Customize syntax highlighting colors and styles in Nano by modifying or creating
a `.nanorc` file in your home directory.

<br />

## Spell Checking Language

Change Nano's spell checking language by setting the `LANG` environment variable
before launching Nano.

<br />

## Cursor Location Persistence

Nano remembers the last cursor position in a file. Disable this feature by
adding `set positionlog` to your `.nanorc`.

<br />

## Clipboard Integration

Copy and paste text between Nano and other applications using `Ctrl + Shift + 6`
to copy selected text and `Ctrl + Shift + U` to paste from the clipboard.

<br />

## External Commands

Execute external commands directly from Nano with shortcuts like `Ctrl + R` to
read in command output, `Ctrl + T` for spell check, and `Ctrl + \` for regular
expression search and replace.

<br />

## Marking Text Blocks

Mark text blocks with `Alt + A` for copying or cutting. Use `Alt + 6` to copy
or\
`Alt + K` to cut the marked text.

<br />

## Line Wrapping

Toggle line wrapping with `Ctrl + \_` (underscore) to fit long lines within the
terminal window.

<br />

## Backup Files

Automatically create backup files before saving changes by adding `set backup`
to your `.nanorc`.

<br />

## External Syntax Highlighting Files

Support additional languages with external syntax highlighting files placed in
`/usr/share/nano` and included in your `.nanorc`.

<br />

## Smart Home Key

Enable smart Home key behavior with `set smarthome` in your `.nanorc` to enhance
cursor movement.

<br />

## Conclusion

These tips and tricks will maximize Nano's features, boosting your text editing
efficiency. Experiment with them to streamline your workflow and become a Nano
power user!
