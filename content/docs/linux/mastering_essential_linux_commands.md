## Introduction

Before diving into the command list, ensure you're familiar with accessing the
command-line interface (CLI). If you need guidance, consider reviewing a CLI
tutorial.

Accessing the command-line may vary depending on your Linux distribution, but
it's typically found in the Utilities section. On Ubuntu, for example, you can
open it by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+T.`

<br />

## Basic Linux Commands Overview

### pwd (Print Working Directory)

Use `pwd` to display the absolute path of your current working directory. This
is useful to verify where you are in the filesystem:

```bash
pwd
```

Example output:

```bash
/home/username
```

<br />

### cd (Change Directory)

Navigate directories using `cd`. Provide either the full path or directory name:

```bash
cd Photos
cd /home/username/Movies
```

Shortcuts:

- `cd ..` moves one directory up.
- `cd` (with no arguments) goes to the home folder.
- `cd -` moves to the previous directory.

<br />

### ls (List)

View directory contents with `ls`:

```bash
ls
ls /home/username/Documents
```

Variations:

- `ls -R` lists files in subdirectories recursively.
- `ls -a` shows hidden files (files starting with a dot (`.`).
- `ls -al` provides a detailed list, including permissions, number of links,
  owner, group, size, and modification time.

For example:

```bash
ls -al /home/username
```

<br />

### cat (Concatenate)

List file contents with `cat`:

```bash
cat file.txt
```

Other usages:

- `cat > filename` (create a new file and write to it):

  ```bash
  cat > newfile.txt
  ```

  Then type your text and press `Ctrl+D` to save.

- `cat filename1 filename2 > filename3` (join files):

  ```bash
  cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
  ```

<br />

### cp (Copy)

Duplicate files using cp:

```bash
cp scenery.jpg /home/username/Pictures
```

For copying directories, use `-r` (recursive):

```bash
cp -r /source_directory /destination_directory
```

<br />

### mv (Move/Rename)

Move or rename files with `mv`:

```bash
mv file.txt /home/username/Documents
mv oldname.ext newname.ext
```

<br />

### mkdir (Make Directory)

Create directories using `mkdir`:

```bash
mkdir Music
```

Additional Options:

- `mkdir Music/Newfile` (create directory within another):

  ```bash
  mkdir Music/Newfile
  ```

  `mkdir -p Music/2020/Newfile` (create nested directory structure):

  ```bash
  mkdir -p Music/2020/Newfile
  ```

<br />

### rmdir (Remove Directory)

Delete empty directories with `rmdir`:

```bash
rmdir emptydir
```

<br />

### rm (Remove)

Delete directories and their contents using `rm`.

Be careful: this action is irreversible. {{% /alert %}}

```bash
rm filename.ext
rm -r directoryname  # to delete a directory and its contents
```

<br />

### touch (Create File)

Create empty files with `touch`:

```bash

```

<br />

### find

Search for files within specified directories:

```bash
find /home/username -name "filename.ext"
```

Find all .txt files:

```bash
find /home/username -type f -name "*.txt"
```

<br />

### grep

Search text within files using `grep`:

```bash
grep "search_term" file.txt
```

Search recursively in all files within a directory:

```bash
grep -r "search_term" /home/username/Documents
```

<br />

## Bonus Tips and Tricks

- Use `clear` to clean the terminal screen:

  ```bash
  clear
  ```

- Utilize TAB for autofilling commands or filenames.
- `Ctrl+C` to terminate a running command.
- `Ctrl+Z` to pause a running command, and `bg` to resume it in the background.
- `Ctrl+S` freezes terminal output; `Ctrl+Q` unfreezes it.
- `Ctrl+A` moves the cursor to the beginning of the line; `Ctrl+E` to the end.
- Run multiple commands in sequence with `;` or conditionally with `&&`:

  ```bash
  command1; command2
  command1 && command2  # command2 runs only if command1 is successful
  ```

These examples should provide you with a good starting point for using the Linux
command-line. Experiment with these commands to become more comfortable with the
CLI environment.
